# A Communication/Reservation Platform for Lecturer's Consultation hours ðŸ’» 
by Srinidhi Gopalraj

>This platform is deployed on [srinidhigpr.pythonanywhere.com](https://srinidhigpr.pythonanywhere.com/), have a go ! test emails are given at the end of the report

## What inspired this idea ðŸ‘€?
Lecturer's consultation hours are often not as transparent as they should be. Despite being able to access it through the university portal, Many students are still in the dark about these timings and have to ask the Lecturer repeatedly for their timings. This can get tiring for the lecturer aswell. This platform was built to adress those concerns and more. Through this platform, 
- students are able to :
    1. Create an event with their lecturer, Allowing them to be informed of their arrival.
    2. Add comments to this event, detailing any questions or concerns they may bring to the consultation hour 
    3. delete an event/consultation notification once their concerns are addressed
- Teachers are able to :
    1. See a list of all students arriving , aswell as their queries, allowing them to be more prepared.
    2. respond to their students comments, noting if their queries are valid and that theyre welcome to the consultation or explain     otherwise
    3. delete an event when it is no longer required.

At this moment I'd like to note that what I've built here is just a framework that can be extended to have greated capabilities. for example, the Observer pattern can use its notifiers to send emails or google calender invites instead of in-page notifications, without changing any of the core functionality. Thus I believe it is important to note that this project has a larger capability and potential through this framework and should be understood as such.

## How to use the program ðŸ’¬?
As mentioned above, the program is currently deployed at [srinidhigpr.pythonanywhere.com](https://srinidhigpr.pythonanywhere.com/). for the purpose of this project I've created 5 students and
